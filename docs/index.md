I will join [Prof. Stefanie Tellex's Lab](https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/people/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) as a Ph.D. student this fall.

I achieved M.S degree in Robotics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), working with [Prof. Lawson Wong](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/lawson-wong/) on the topic of vision-language navigation. I majored in Mechanical Engineering, while I later found my interest in deep learning & robotics and transferred to Robotics program in 2020, after finishing my internship at [Analogic](https://www.analogic.com/).

Prior to NEU, I recevied my B.Eng at School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation of [Northeastern University (CN)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yaping Zhao](http://www.me.neu.edu.cn/2015/1105/c3344a55926/pagem.htm).

Currently, I'm leading a happy life with my girlfriend and my cat at Boston :)
## Current Interests:

- Improving the performance of instruction generator for data augmentation in vision-language navigation task.
- Solving the reward sparsity of reinforcement learning in the context of language generation
- Implementing language grounding into real-world circumstance
- *Reading manga* Here is [my manga rating page](https://butternut-bagpipe-9e8.notion.site/Manga-ff90216138c54dadbd48a88221c330c1)
