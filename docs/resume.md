## Research Experience

`Jan 2021-Current`
__Improving Vision-based Text Generation by Multi-modal Reinforcement Learning__ <br>
GRAIL lab, Northeastern University, Boston, MA
- Proposed a new method to enhance the performance of language generation model for vision-language navigation by using REINFORCE with multi-modal rewards (BERTScore, VLN agents, ANN scorer)
- Reproduced and improved compatibility model by implementing more robust approach on hard negative mining
- Investigated in training the model with GAN structure by combining the compatibility model with the generation model
