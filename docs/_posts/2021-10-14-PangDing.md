After waiting for a week because of her spay surgery, we finally picked her up at [Northeast Animal Shelter](https://www.northeastanimalshelter.org/). We decided to name her 'Pang-Ding', which is the Chinese name of the Pokémon 'Jigglypuff'. Ruthie is her offical name on the documents, and Lyu is my girlfriend's last name (she's the official adopter), so her full name is __Pang-Ding·'Ruthie'·Lyu__.

Finally arrived home, we've never driven so carefully, and she's meowing all the way.

The second day of adoption. She's literally adorable when you wake up with her by your side.

A nice catch by my girlfriend.
